### Setup

Clone this repository.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:application-research/next-daemon-bucket.git
cd next-daemon-bucket
```

You will want to create a `.env.local` file. The command you use is: `touch .env.local`. In this file you will want to include your Textile Hub keys and other secrets you don't want exposed.

The easiest way to generate your `user group` keys for Textile is to download the latest version of the  `hub` https://github.com/textileio/textile/releases/tag/v2.6.6

* Stuck? Read this: [https://docs.textile.io/hub/apis/](https://docs.textile.io/hub/apis/). Post an issue if you have any questions :-)

```env
TEXTILE_HUB_KEY=XXX
TEXTILE_HUB_SECRET=XXX
DAEMON_LAND_KEY=XXX
```

Now run the server.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser of choice. Enjoy!
